# Ring-Defaults

Knowing what middleware to add to a Ring application, and in what
order, can be difficult and prone to error.

This library attempts to automate the process, by providing sensible
and secure default configurations of Ring middleware for both websites
and HTTP APIs.

**Note:** Ring-Defaults is currently in development and not yet released.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

    [ring/ring-defaults "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

## Basic Usage

If you're constructing a website:

```clojure
(def site
  (wrap-defaults handler site-defaults)
```

If you're constructing an API:

```clojure
(def api
  (wrap-defaults handler api-defaults)
```
